About
======
Thank you for visiting and welcome! My research interests are in corporate and entrepreneurial finance, entrepreneurship and innovation, and strategy.

Having practical experience from stints in management consulting and banking, I enjoy advising and mentoring start-ups. Before UCLA, I was the head of the global resolution planning office at Commerzbank AG.

I received my education in mathematics and economics in Hamburg, Paris and Cambridge. My academic work has been recognized with a number of prizes, including the Sorbonne-Prize of the University of Paris, a number of awards from the University of Cambridge such as the Cambridge University scholarship, and a full scholarship of the German National Merit Foundation. My recent publication on how <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0929119919301142?dgcid=author" target="_blank">European competition policy impedes an efficient market for corporate control</a> was nominated for a best paper award by the Financial Management Association.
