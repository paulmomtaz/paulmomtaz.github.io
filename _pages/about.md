About
======
Thank you for visiting, and welcome! I currently work at <a href="https://www.tum.de/en/about-tum" target="_blank">TUM</a> <a href="https://www.mgt.tum.de/" target="_blank">School of Management</a> where I am holding the ''Professur f√ºr Entrepreneurial Finance.'' Previously, I held the Chair of Private Equity at the House of Finance in Frankfurt, my hometown in Germany, where I had returned at the onset of the pandemic. I received my Ph.D. in Finance from UCLA and had affiliations with the Wharton School as the Metzler Visiting Professor in the Management Department and as a Research Associate with the Centre of Blockchain Technologies at University College London's Computer Science Department. I visited Dietmar Harhoff's group at the Max-Planck-Institute for Innovation and Competition in Munich in May/June 2022. I am also a Fellow in the <a href="https://www.cesifo.org/en/research-network-area/economics-of-digitization" target="_blank">Economics of Digitization Area</a> at <a href="https://www.cesifo.org/en" target="_blank">CESifo</a>.

My primary research interest is in decentralized markets, platforms, and organizations (often related to crypto and blockchain). My research focuses on value creation, appropriation, and competition in decentralized settings, and empirically assesses the aggregate efficiency of decentralized markets. <!--In particular, I  draw on search theory to estimate preference and technology parameters that rationalize individual behavior in decentralized settings, which I then use to construct frictionless counterfactual efficiency benchmarks. This helps to identify the sources of inefficiency in decentralized settings and potential policies to improve efficiency.--> My secondary research interests are in the intersection of corporate strategy and finance (e.g., mergers and acquisitions, private equity, firm value and performance), labor and innovation, entrepreneurship and entrepreneurial finance, ESG/sustainability, and emotions and affective decision-making.

For my most recent research, see my <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/cf_dev/AbsByAuth.cfm?per_id=2433926" target="_blank">SSRN</a> profile.

<!--I am a Finance PhD candidate at UCLA Anderson; before that, I was a PhD student in the Innovation, Strategy, and Organisation Group at Cambridge University. My research interests include corporate finance, strategy, innovation, and entrepreneurship. Most of my work is in the intersection of at least two of these fields.-->

<!--Having practical experience from stints in management consulting and banking, I enjoy advising and mentoring start-ups. Before UCLA, I was the head of the global resolution planning office at Commerzbank AG.-->

<!--I received my education in mathematics and economics in Hamburg, Paris and Cambridge. My academic work has been recognized with a number of prizes, including the Sorbonne-Prize of the University of Paris, a number of awards from the University of Cambridge such as the Cambridge University scholarship, and a full scholarship of the German National Merit Foundation. My recent publication on how <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0929119919301142?dgcid=author" target="_blank">European competition policy impedes an efficient market for corporate control</a> was nominated for a best paper award by the Financial Management Association.-->
