About
======
Thank you for visiting and welcome! I am a Finance PhD candidate at UCLA Anderson; before that, I was a PhD student in the Innovation, Strategy, and Organisation Group at Cambridge University. My research interests include corporate finance, strategy, innovation, and entrepreneurship. Most of my work is in the intersection of at least two of these fields.

<!--Having practical experience from stints in management consulting and banking, I enjoy advising and mentoring start-ups. Before UCLA, I was the head of the global resolution planning office at Commerzbank AG.-->

<!--I received my education in mathematics and economics in Hamburg, Paris and Cambridge. My academic work has been recognized with a number of prizes, including the Sorbonne-Prize of the University of Paris, a number of awards from the University of Cambridge such as the Cambridge University scholarship, and a full scholarship of the German National Merit Foundation. My recent publication on how <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0929119919301142?dgcid=author" target="_blank">European competition policy impedes an efficient market for corporate control</a> was nominated for a best paper award by the Financial Management Association.-->
