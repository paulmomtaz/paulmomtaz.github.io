excerpt: 'Decentralized fundraising through Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) for early-stage ventures is one important new business model that has only become viable through blockchain technology and smart contracts. Utility tokens, voucher-like assets providing access to a service or product that a venture promises to provide in the future, are generally considered as perfectly disintermediated peer-to-peer transactions, thus representing a prime example for decentralized finance (DeFi). Traditional venture fundraising involves substantial frictions, because many investors only trust and invest in projects with strong network ties. ICOs, as a form of token-based crowdfunding, allow startup ventures to raise funds in a trustless way from previously unknown investors across the globe.'
