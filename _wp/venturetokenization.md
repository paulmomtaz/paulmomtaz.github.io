abstract: 'After initial coin offerings (ICOs), decentralized digital platforms (DDPs) decide whether to go public or remain private. We explore the implications of the public-versus-private decision for the growth and decentralization of DDPs. Employing a difference-indifferences framework, we find that public DDPs scale faster post-listing relative to matched private DDPs. An important driver behind public DDPs’ superior growth is a spillover effect of financial speculation on fundamental platform activity, especially when DDPs are undervalued, hastening network effects. The going-public decision also facilitates DDP decentralization, although this stems mostly from the left tail of the token ownership distribution, while blockholders largely remain in control. Exploring the trade-off between going public through token exchange listings and remaining private with the help of institutional investors, we find that crypto fund-endorsed token listings yield more platform growth than unendorsed listings, while crypto fund backings without listings create the least value. Overall, our study suggests that early-stage startups may economically benefit from tokenization and creating liquid markets for venture tokens.'
