abstract: 'Blockchain-based tokens are widely acknowledged as a new asset class. Tokens allow new ventures to raise financing from crowd-investors on public blockchains. The information stored on these public ledgers makes it possible to examine the crowdâ€™s investment behavior, as well as the financial returns to individual investors in the cross-section of the crowd. We spearhead this emerging literature by examining the evolution and behavior of individual wallets along several dimensions on the largest financial database in the world, the Ethereum blockchain. Our findings suggest that investment success, measured as absolute and risk-adjusted returns, can be predicted by several features of crowd investor behavior, such as trading activity, portfolio diversification, and investments in lottery-type tokens. We also observe that investor attention and demand for investments in startups explain returns, and that these effects vary significantly by wallet size. Overall, our study highlights that ''wisdom of the crowd'' is segmented, and predicting which parts of the crowd are smart (i.e., achieve higher returns) is relatively straight-forward'
