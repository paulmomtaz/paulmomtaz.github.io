abstract: 'DeFi markets promise more economic surplus to their users thanks to disintermediation. Yet, many DeFi markets, such as the market for token offerings, are characterized by an increasing number of institutional investors that reintroduce a certain degree of intermediation. What role do institutional investors play in DeFi markets? Reduced-form 2SLS and IV analyses suggest that institutional investors reduce search frictions in the market for tokens offerings by reducing the time startups need to achieve their fundraising goal, while they demand relatively high token price discounts as compensation. To better understand the magnitude of search frictions, how they influence token allocations and valuations, as well as aggregate welfare in the DeFi market, we structurally estimate a search-and-bargaining model that accounts for startup heterogeneity due to the underlying platform size. Relative to the Walrasian equilibrium, token market efficiency is reduced substantially because search frictions prevent token allocations to the highest-value user and institutional investorsâ€™ bargaining power leads to lower token prices. Counterfactual analyses shed more light on the magnitude of search frictions and the welfare effects of institutional investors in DeFi markets.'
