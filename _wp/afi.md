abstract: 'This paper examines the relation between academic freedom and innovation around the globe since the early 1900s. We find that the quantity and quality of patents reacts positively to improvements to academic freedom. A one standard deviation increase in academic freedom translates into 300 more patent filings and 50 more forward citations per one million inhabitants. Using a historic instrumental variable approach, we show that there is a causal link between academic freedom and innovation at the jurisdiction level.'
