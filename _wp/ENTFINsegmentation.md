abstract: 'We show that sustainability segments entrepreneurial finance markets by investor types in token-based crowdfunding, a market that is populated by individual and institutional investors alike. While ventures backed by institutional investor do not (need to) emphasize environmental, social, and governance (ESG) ambitions, non-backed ventures raising funds from masses of individual contributors display salient ESG orientations, with a disproportiantely pronounced governance dimension. ESG helps ventures unsuccessful in securing institutional investments partially compensate for the funding disadvantage, as individuals exhibit higher willingness-toinvest in sustainable ventures. Using artificial intelligence to separate ESG orientations into two latent sources, substantive and symbolic, we find that symbolic ESG is more prevalent in non-backed ventures, potentially suggesting "greenwashing." The startup valuations of individual investors are affected by substantive and symbolic ESG orientations, although symbolic claims do not compensate for the lack of institutional certification. Overall, sustainability-driven market segmentation is in line with the conjecture that individual investors perceive sustainability as a legitimization substitute for ventures that lack certification from institutional investors.'
