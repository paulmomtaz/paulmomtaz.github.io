abstract: 'The majority of inventions generated in modern economies are developed by employed individuals on the behalf of their employer. This paper provides first representative evidence on the marginal income per patent (MIP) to employed inventors. To this end, we explore administrative data for a representative sample of 148,743 unique inventors in Germany linked to their income and patenting activities. We find the average inventor earns a MIP of 7% per annum over the patent lifecycle. These results are particularly pronounced for high quality patents and in firms for which the marginal contribution of patents is high. Moreover, exploring the labor mobility effects of across-firm variation in the MIP, we find that firms that pay above-average premium recruit a higher number of high-quality inventors.'
