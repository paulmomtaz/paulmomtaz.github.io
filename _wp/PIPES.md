abstract: 'Our paper estimates that shares in Private Investments in Public Equity (PIPEs) offered a discount of 3-4% for each year during which these shares could not be resold.  Our estimates make use of the duration of the resale restriction and information about the effects of a regulatory change.  In 2008, the SEC amended Rule~144 to shorten the default statutory holding period.  Our estimates are smaller than previous estimates and robust to various controls and endogeneity concerns.  The discount can be twice as large in offerings in which marketability is a greater concern.'
