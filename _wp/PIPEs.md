abstract: 'The pricing of illiquidity (due to lack of marketability) is a contentious issue in Private Investments in Public Equity (PIPEs). We exploit the 2008 amendment to Rule 144(k) to estimate the effect of the shortening of the mandatory holding period on the discount for lack of marketability (DLOM). The annualized inferred DLOM is 3-4%. The DLOM can increase when marketability is a greater concern. Our paper also contributes to the “PIPE performance puzzle.” The average discount-adjusted return to PIPE investors is statistically zero over the expected illiquidity period. Nevertheless, existing theories can explain cross-sectional variation in the post-PIPE performance of issuing companies.'
