abstract: 'The role of violent conflict for entrepreneurial activity is relatively underexplored and controversial in the entrepreneurship literature. Drawing on institutional theory, a country’s level of conflict should reduce individuals’ propensities to engage in entrepreneurship and shift the relative share of activity from opportunity to necessity entrepreneurship. We confirm these predictions in a multilevel analysis of a longitudinal sample of 1.2 million individuals from 86 countries over the 2009–2017 period, whilst addressing endogeneity concerns associated with entrepreneurial selection. Our results draw a more nuanced picture of war’s entrepreneurial ramifications by unveiling heterogeneous treatment effects for opportunity and necessity entrepreneurship.  Importantly, although violent conflict comes as an exogenous shock to individual entrepreneurs, individual entrepreneurs’ socio-cognitive traits determine their sensitivity to the institutional shock, with individuals’ perceived entrepreneurial network positions, entrepreneurial skills, and fear of failure emerging as strong moderatoring forces.'
