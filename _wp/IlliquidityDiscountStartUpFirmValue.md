abstract: 'We examine a novel dataset containing more than 60,000 venture capital (VC) transactions during the 2000-2019 period. We identify the illiquidity discount on start-up firm value using a reverse engineering approach, in which we infer the actual illiquidity discount from actual exit prices (either through M&A or IPO) in combination with details about the initial VC deals and the actual illiquidity period. We are able to econometrically disentangle endogenous screening and coaching effects in VC-backed start-up firms using a rich fixed-effects specficiation.'
