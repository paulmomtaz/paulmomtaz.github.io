excerpt: "The Toxic Chemical Emissions Database (TCED) consists of all non-greenhouse gas (non-GHG) toxic chemical emissions in the US and Europe. To facilitate cross-continental comparisons, we have harmonized the reported chemicals, based on OECD suggestions. We also propose a novel measure of industrial chemical pollution that accounts for the toxicity of the more than 800 tracked chemicals."

The Token Chemical Emissions Database (TCED) consists of all non-greenhouse gas toxic chemical emissions in the US and Europe. To facilitate cross-continental comparisons, we have harmonized the reported chemicals, based on OECD suggestions. Further, we measure the toxicity-adjusted chemical emissions (TACE), a new metric that quantifies industrial chemical pollution weighted by the toxicity of the emitted chemicals at each production plant and at corporate headquarters, for a more meaningful measure of the real impact of such emissions on the natural environment and human organisms. Please read our readme file for further details. 

Version control:
- V1: toxic chemical emissions in the US and Europe, as reported in the US EPA's and EU's registries, as well as harmonized based on OECD guidelines, as explained in the readme document.
