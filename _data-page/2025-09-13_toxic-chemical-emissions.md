The Token Chemical Emissions Database (TCED) consists of all non-greenhouse gas (non-GHG) toxic chemical emissions in the US and Europe. To facilitate cross-continental comparisons, we have harmonized the reported chemicals, based on OECD suggestions. Please read our readme file for further details. To our knowledge, as of September 2025, the TCED is more comprehensive than any other publicly available database that covers industrial non-GHG toxic chemical emissions. The TCED is neither 100% complete nor is it 100% correct (presumably). Therefore, caveat emptor: If you use the data, be aware of these potential issues, and if you spot a mistake, please email me.

Version control:
- V1: toxic chemical emissions in the US and Europe, as reported in the US EPA's and EU's registries, as well as harmonized based on OECD guidelines, as explained in the readme document.
