excerpt: "Universal Instrumental Variables (UnIVs) help to address the endogeneity problem associated with the reflection problem in peer groups (i.e., disentangling the causal effect from a firm-specific treatment from a potentially latent variable that affects the entire peer group). The data help to causally identify peer effects in any product market classified by SIC codes. The instrumental variables have desirable properties, such as a (by econometrical construction) guaranteed exclusion restriction. "

Read the readme-univs.txt file for information. The data include Peer Shocks, which represent UNIVs at the SIC3 level. The data also include Firm Shocks, which can be used to construct Peer Shocks at any SIC level. A working paper describing the data and an application will be posted soon.
