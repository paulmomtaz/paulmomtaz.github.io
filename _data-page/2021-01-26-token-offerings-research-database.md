The Token Offerings Research Database (TORD) consists of hand-collected ICOs, IEOs, and STOs. As of January 2021, the TORD is more comprehensive than any other publicly available token offerings database. The TORD partly resolves a number of issues with commercially available data, such as the pronounced survivorship bias. However, neither is the TORD 100% complete nor is it 100% correct (presumably). Therefore, caveat emptor: If you use the data, be aware of these potential issues, and if you spot a mistake, please email me.

The TORD (since version 2) contains more than 6,400 ICOs, IEOs, and STOs in an integrated data file. It is work in progress. Both the number of rows as well as the number of columns will expand over time.

Version control:
- V1: all token offerings until 12/2020
- V2 (live since June 12, 2021): Update includes links to Github and LinkedIn websites, the average project rating, the team size, and a Coinmarketcap identifier (enabling you to link more than 1,000 offerings to post-offering token price performance data)
