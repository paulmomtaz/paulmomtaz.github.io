excerpt: "The code implements a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) model to classify cybercriminal and non-cybercriminal addresses on the Ethereum blockchain, using ATGraph technology. Our approach uses several on-chain input features for classification (i.e., ). It builds on <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4527415" target="_blank">Hornuf, Momtaz, Nam, and Ye (2024)</a> and is designed to perform well in samples of limited size."
