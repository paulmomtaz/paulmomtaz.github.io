excerpt: "Schumpeterian economists hold that entrepreneurial activity will solve the grand Environment, Society, and Governance (ESG) challenges of our time. Yet, existing studies find mixed results as to whether sustainability-oriented entrepreneurship is economically attractive for entrepreneurs and investors alike. A large part of the empirical problem is the missing consensus about how to measure ESG in the startup context."

Schumpeterian economists hold that entrepreneurial activity will solve the grand Environment, Society, and Governance (ESG) challenges of our time. Yet, existing studies find mixed results as to whether sustainability-oriented entrepreneurship is economically attractive for entrepreneurs and investors alike. A large part of the empirical problem is the missing consensus about how to measure ESG in the startup context. In our paper titled <i>Financing Sustainable Entrepreneurship: ESG Measurement, Valuation, and Performance in Token Offerings</i>, we suggest to measure ESG properties of startups from text data (e.g., whitepapers, blog posts, mission statements, entries on databases like <i>Crunchbase</i>, and so on) via a machine learning approach. To that end, we taught a computer to identify ESG-related language based on all Financial Times articles under the tags >>moral money<< and >>ESG investing<<, as well as startup-specific language. The Python source code is available in the Supplementary Materials of our paper. To facilitate the use of our approach, we developed an easy-to-use web app where you can paste text and immediately obtain ESG scores for the text. The web app is available at: <a href="https://www.sustainableentrepreneurship.org/" target="_blank">www.SustainableEntrepreneurship.org</a> We hope that a broad adoption of our method will make future research on sustainable entrepreneurship more comparable.
